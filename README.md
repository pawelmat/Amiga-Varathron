## Development environment

A system with minimum 0.5MB chip is required, and some additional fast or chip memory to host the sources. Can be a real Amiga or emulator-based.

Seka (most likely) or AsmOne is needed to assemble the source code.

## Assembly

This part is a bit more complicated as the floppy it came may have had bad sectors, so some of the files may be damaged. They also need some tidying up w.r.t. the includes and externs.
